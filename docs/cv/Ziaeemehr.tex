%I am a postdoctoral researcher at Institut de Neuroscience des Systèmes- Inserm UMR 1106 at Aix-Marseille University, France, under the direction of Prof. Viktor Jirsa aims to use Bayesian inference and deep learning techniques to infer the dynamics of personalized large scale brain network focusing on epilepsy and aging.

I am a computational neuroscientist. My research focuses on developing Bayesian methods to study whole-brain network dynamics. I also have experience with deep learning methods and have applied these techniques to analyze data from electrophysiological recordings in rats and humans.
 
%I got my Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience at Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Science (IASBS) Zanjan, Iran. Currently, I have some collaboration   
%at Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (\textit{IPM Tehran}) as a researcher and I am data scientist at \textit{Panoptopia} company.
%My thesis meeting has been scheduled for the next week, but it will be postponed for a few weeks until normal condition and reopening the university.

%\cvitem{Supervisors}{Mina Zarei, Alireza Valizadeh}
%\cvitem{Description}{The goal of my research was to develop a theoretical framework and computational tools for studying the collective behavior and synchronization of neural populations and phase oscillators. For example, I investigated the effects of the time delay, number, length, and place of directed loops, the interplay between node dynamics and network structure on the collective behavior of the networks. I also worked on the information processing at hierarchical complex networks.}
